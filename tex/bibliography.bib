In practice, all such methods reduce, on the computer, to forms of least-squares. The global oceanographic problem is at the present time focussed primarily on smoothing, rather than forecasting, and the data types are unlike meteorological ones. As formulated in the consortium Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), an automatic differentiation tool is used to calculate the so-called adjoint code of the GCM, and the method of Lagrange multipliers used to render the problem one of unconstrained least-squares minimization. Major problems today lie less with the numerical algorithms (least-squares problems can be solved by many means) than with the issues of data and model error. Results of ongoing calculations covering the period of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and including among other data, satellite altimetry from TOPEX/POSEIDON, Jason-1, ERS- 1/2, ENVISAT, and GFO, a global array of profiling floats from the Argo program, and satellite gravity data from the GRACE mission, suggest that the solutions are now useful for scientific purposes. Both methodology and applications are developing in a number of different directions.}",

These fields develop formulations that integrate data into physics-based models while exploiting the fact that many mathematical models of natural and engineered systems exhibit an intrinsically low-dimensional solution manifold. In inverse problems, we seek to infer uncertain components of the inputs from observations of the outputs, while in model reduction we seek low-dimensional models that explicitly capture the salient features of the input–output map through approximation in a low-dimensional subspace. In both cases, the result is a predictive model that reflects data-driven learning yet deeply embeds the underlying physics, and thus can be used for design, control and decision-making, often with quantified uncertainties. We highlight recent developments in scalable and efficient algorithms for inverse problems and model reduction governed by large-scale models in the form of partial differential equations. Several illustrative applications to large-scale complex problems across different domains of science and engineering are provided.}",

    abstractNote = "Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems. The rapidly developing field of physics-informed learning integrates data and mathematical models seamlessly, enabling accurate inference of realistic and high-dimensional multiphysics problems. This Review discusses the methodology and provides diverse examples and an outlook for further developments. Physics-informed machine learning integrates seamlessly data and mathematical physics models, even in partially understood, uncertain and high-dimensional contexts.Kernel-based or neural network-based regression methods offer effective, simple and meshless implementations.Physics-informed neural networks are effective and efficient for ill-posed and inverse problems, and combined with domain decomposition are scalable to large problems.Operator regression, search for new intrinsic variables and representations, and equivariant neural network architectures with built-in physical constraints are promising areas of future research.There is a need for developing new frameworks and standardized benchmarks as well as new mathematics for scalable, robust and rigorous next-generation physics-informed learning machines.

In this manuscript we detail the inner workings of NeuralPDE.jl and show how a formulation structured around numerical quadrature gives rise to new loss functions which allow for adaptivity towards bounded error tolerances. We describe the various ways one can use the tool, detailing mathematical techniques like using extended loss functions for parameter estimation and operator discovery, to help potential users adopt these PINN-based techniques into their workflow. We showcase how NeuralPDE uses a purely symbolic formulation so that all of the underlying training code is generated from an abstract formulation, and show how to make use of GPUs and solve systems of PDEs. Afterwards we give a detailed performance analysis which showcases the trade-off between training techniques on a large set of PDEs. We end by focusing on a complex multiphysics example, the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) Model, and showcase how this PDE can be formulated and solved with NeuralPDE. Together this manuscript is meant to be a detailed and approachable technical report to help potential users of the technique quickly get a sense of the real-world performance trade-offs and use cases of the PINN techniques.",

In the present work, BINNs are trained in a supervised learning framework to approximate in vitro cell biology assay experiments while respecting a generalized form of the governing reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE). By allowing the diffusion and reaction terms to be multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), the nonlinear forms of these terms can be learned while simultaneously converging to the solution of the governing PDE. Further, the trained MLPs are used to guide the selection of biologically interpretable mechanistic forms of the PDE terms which provides new insights into the biological and physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the observed system. The method is evaluated on sparse real-world data from wound healing assays with varying initial cell densities [2].",

Other reasons, which of course apply to numerical analysis in general, are in the invention of electronic computers half way through the century and the needs in mathematical modelling of efficient numerical algorithms as an alternative to classical methods of applied mathematics.

Research in IML has boomed in recent years. As young as the field is, it has over 200 years old roots in regression modeling and rule-based machine learning, starting in the 1960s. Recently, many new IML methods have been proposed, many of them model-agnostic, but also interpretation techniques specific to deep learning and tree-based ensembles. IML methods either directly analyze model components, study sensitivity to input perturbations, or analyze local or global surrogate approximations of the ML model. The field approaches a state of readiness and stability, with many methods not only proposed in research, but also implemented in open-source software. But many important challenges remain for IML, such as dealing with dependent features, causal interpretation, and uncertainty estimation, which need to be resolved for its successful application to scientific problems. A further challenge is a missing rigorous definition of interpretability, which is accepted by the community. To address the challenges and advance the field, we urge to recall our roots of interpretable, data-driven modeling in statistics and (rule-based) ML, but also to consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and the social sciences.}",

On the other hand, massive potential gains in performance over standard, "experience-driven" layouts are in principle within our reach if an objective function fully aligned with the final goals of the instrument is maximized by means of a systematic search of the configuration space. The stochastic nature of the involved quantum processes make the modeling of these systems an intractable problem from a classical statistics point of view, yet the construction of a fully differentiable pipeline and the use of deep learning techniques may allow the simultaneous optimization of all design parameters. In this document we lay down our plans for the design of a modular and versatile modeling tool for the end-to-end optimization of complex instruments for particle physics experiments as well as industrial and medical applications that share the detection of radiation as their basic ingredient. We consider a selected set of use cases to highlight the specific needs of different applications.}},

We provide an overview of fundamental concepts in quantum chemistry, including the basic principles of the Hartree-Fock method. A flagship feature in PennyLane is the differentiable Hartree-Fock solver, allowing users to compute exact gradients of molecular Hamiltonians with respect to nuclear coordinates and basis set parameters. PennyLane provides specialized operations for quantum chemistry, including excitation gates as Givens rotations and templates for quantum chemistry circuits. Moreover, built-in simulators exploit sparse matrix techniques for representing molecular Hamiltonians that lead to fast simulation for quantum chemistry applications. In combination with PennyLane's existing methods for constructing, optimizing, and executing circuits, these methods allow users to implement a wide range of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. We discuss how PennyLane can be used to implement variational algorithms for calculating ground-state energies, excited-state energies, and energy derivatives, all of which can be differentiated with respect to both circuit and Hamiltonian parameters. We provide an example workflow describing how to jointly optimize circuit parameters, nuclear coordinates, and basis set parameters for quantum chemistry algorithms. We discuss a functionality for reducing the number of qubits by using symmetries and explain how PennyLane can be used to estimate quantum resources needed to implement several quantum algorithms. By combining insights from quantum computing, computational chemistry, and machine learning, PennyLane is the first library for differentiable quantum computational chemistry.}",

Successive gradients thus computed are introduced into a descent algorithm in order to determine the initial conditions which define the minimizing model solution.

Except over the eastern Pacific Ocean, where no observations are available, the variational assimilation reconstructs all structures of the flow resolvable by the model to an accuracy of about 30 m for geopotential heights and 8 m s−1 for wind vectors. A particular structure, the Aleutian depression, is reconstructed even though it was not covered by the available observations. The assimilation produces unrealistic small‐scale noise which can be reduced by adding an appropriate smoothing term to the distance function minimized in the variational process. Detailed study of the minimization strongly suggests that the distance function varies quadratically with respect to the model's initial conditions. This implies that the tangent linear equation of the model suffices to describe the 24‐hour evolution of the forecast error.}",

    abstract = "{In variational data assimilation (VDA) for meteorological and/or oceanic models, the assimilated fields are deduced by combining the model and the gradient of a cost functional measuring discrepancy between model solution and observation, via a first-order optimality system. However, existence and uniqueness of the VDA problem along with convergence of the algorithms for its implementation depend on the convexity of the cost function. Properties of local convexity can be deduced by studying the Hessian of the cost function in the vicinity of the optimum. This shows the necessity of second-order information to ensure a unique solution to the VDA problem. In this paper a comprehensive review of issues related to second-order analysis of the problem of VDA is presented along with many important issues closely connected to it. In particular issues of existence, uniqueness, and regularization through second-order properties are examined. The focus then shifts to second-order information related to statistical properties and to issues related to preconditioning and optimization methods and second-order VDA analysis. Predictability and its relation to the structure of the Hessian of the cost functional is then discussed along with issues of sensitivity analysis in the presence of data being assimilated. Computational complexity issues are also addressed and discussed. Automatic differentiation issues related to second-order information are also discussed along with the computational complexity of deriving the second-order adjoint. Finally an application aimed at illustrating the use of automatic differentiation for deriving the second-order adjoint as well as the Hessian/vector product applied to minimizing a cost functional of a meteorological problem using the truncated-Newton method is presented. Results verifying numerically the computational cost of deriving the second-order adjoint as well as results related to the spectrum of the Hessian of the cost functional are displayed and discussed.}",

The outputs from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are pervasive throughout society, and now provide skillful forecasts a week into the future.

Consideration of perturbation energetics requires that such disturbances produce down-gradient momentum fluxes which are associated with perturbation phase lines oriented against the mean shear. Initial conditions chosen arbitrarily, except that they satisfy this requirement, have been shown to result in robust excitation of neutral waves. A question naturally arising from such studies is whether there exists, in some well-defined sense, a best or most effective choice of initial conditions which optimally excites the waves. This question is addressed as a variational problem, and examples of optimal initial conditions are identified for the barotropic β-plane channel. These examples include the most effective excitation of a given neutral Rossby mode and the most rapidly growing perturbation for a given time period without restriction on spectra composition.}",

Information about the resolution and the error-covariances of the model parameters can be computed. This information is shown to be very valuable for critically evaluating how well the data determine the parameter's values. An adjoint model, similar in structure to the numerical model, uses information on model-data misfit to improve estimates of the unknown model parameters, and improve the fit to observations.

We have studied the singular vectors of an intermediate coupled ocean‐atmosphere model of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in an effort to understand the dynamics responsible for the growth of small perturbations in the tropics. In particular, we have examined how the singular vectors of the observed seasonal cycle are influenced by various thermodynamic processes which operate in the upper‐ocean mixed‐layer, and which affect sea‐surface temperature (SST). These processes include vertical movements of the main thermocline, zonal advection and vertical upwelling. the main findings are: the singular vector spectrum is dominated by the fastest growing member, regardless of which thermodynamic processes are active; the growth factors of the singular vectors exhibit a strong seasonal dependence; the western and central parts of the Pacific Ocean are the areas most often favoured for growth by the singular vectors, and the general criteria that must be met for singular‐vector growth have been determined; at a given time of year, the growth factors of the singular vectors are sensitive to different combinations of thermodynamic processes, although the configuration of the dominant singular‐vector wind field after optimal growth has been achieved is very similar in all cases. This suggests that in the tropics, the coupled system has a preferred response that the ocean thermodynamics controlling SST conspire to produce, regardless of which processes are operating in the mixed layer; the observed ENSO cycle is likely to influence singular‐vector growth significantly. the singular vector spectrum is dominated by the fastest growing member, regardless of which thermodynamic processes are active; the growth factors of the singular vectors exhibit a strong seasonal dependence; the western and central parts of the Pacific Ocean are the areas most often favoured for growth by the singular vectors, and the general criteria that must be met for singular‐vector growth have been determined; at a given time of year, the growth factors of the singular vectors are sensitive to different combinations of thermodynamic processes, although the configuration of the dominant singular‐vector wind field after optimal growth has been achieved is very similar in all cases.

In this study, we have examined how the model singular‐vectors are affected by variations in certain model parameters, some of which mathematically define the singular vectors. the important findings of this study can be summarized as follows: the behaviour of the model singular‐vectors can be understood in terms of a superposition of the linear modes of the coupled system which are non‐orthogonal. In some cases, the gravest modes are oscillatory in time and this leads to resonances in the singular‐vector growth‐factors. the singular‐vector spectrum is generally dominated by its fastest‐growing member whose wind structure is relatively insensitive to the parameters that define the singular vectors mathematically. This result is in accord with the findings of Part I, and suggests that, in the tropics, the coupled system has a preferred response to perturbations, and that this response will readily manifest itself if conditions are favourable. Favourably configured perturbations can undergo rapid transient growth over the entire regime in which the coupled model is asymptotically stable (i.e. when there are no unstable modes in the system). In this regime, rapid transient growth can occur over a wide range of timescales from 1 week to 24 months. the behaviour of the model singular‐vectors can be understood in terms of a superposition of the linear modes of the coupled system which are non‐orthogonal.

The results and ideas presented here have important ramifications for the way in which the real coupled oceanatmosphere system will respond in the tropics to perturbations arising from stochastic forcing inherent in the system. the dynamical operators that govern the early stages of linear perturbation‐development are non‐normal which means that the ubiquitous stochastic noise present in the tropics can be amplified. the dynamical mechanisms by which this can occur are the same as those responsible for the growth of the system singular‐vectors. the dominant singular‐vectors of the coupled model bear a remarkable resemblance to the tropical‐cyclone pairs that are often observed spanning the equator in the western Pacific Ocean accompanied by strong westerly wind bursts, and thought to be precursors of El Niño events. We propose that both westerly and easterly wind bursts occuring in nature are a preferred response of the coupled system in the tropics to its inherent stochastic noise component.}",

    abstract = "{The role of ocean dynamics in optimally exciting interannual variability of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies is investigated using an idealized-geometry ocean general circulation model. Initial temperature and salinity perturbations leading to an optimal growth of tropical SST anomalies, typically arising from the nonnormal dynamics, are evaluated. The structure of the optimal perturbations is characterized by relatively strong deep salinity anomalies near the western boundary generating a transient amplification of equatorial SST anomalies in less than four years. The associated growth mechanism is linked to the excitation of coastal and equatorial Kelvin waves near the western boundary following a rapid geostrophic adjustment owing to the optimal initial temperature and salinity perturbations. The results suggest that the nonnormality of the ocean dynamics may efficiently create large tropical SST variability on interannual time scales in the Atlantic without the participation of air–sea processes or the meridional overturning circulation. An optimal deep initial salinity perturbation of 0.1 ppt located near the western boundary can result in a tropical SST anomaly of approximately 0.45°C after nearly four years, assuming the dynamics are linear. Possible mechanisms for exciting such deep perturbations are discussed. While this study is motivated by tropical Atlantic SST variability, its relevance to other basins is not excluded. The optimal initial conditions leading to the tropical SST anomalies’ growth are obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The evaluation of the optimals is achieved by using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) tangent linear and adjoint models as well the the Arnoldi Package (ARPACK) software for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems.}",

    abstract = "{A three‐dimensional oceanic state is estimated for the period 1992–1997 as it results from combining large‐scale ocean data sets with a general circulation model. At the cost of increased computational load, the estimation (assimilation) method is chosen specifically so that the resulting state estimate is consistent with the model equations, having no artificial sources or sinks. To bring the model into close agreement with observations, its initial temperature and salinity conditions are permitted to change, as are the time‐dependent surface fluxes of momentum, heat and freshwater. Resulting changes of these “control vectors” are largely consistent with accepted uncertainties in the hydrographic climatology and meteorological analyses. The assimilation procedure is able to correct for many of the traditional shortcomings of the flow field by changing the surface boundary conditions. Changes in the resulting flow field are predominantly on the gyre scale and affect many features that are often poorly simulated in traditional numerical simulations, such as the strengths of the Gulf Stream and its extension, the Azores Current and the anticyclonic circulation associated with the Labrador Sea. Tests of the results and their consistency with prior error assumptions show that the constrained model has moved considerably closer to the observations imposed as constraints, but has also moved closer to independent data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment not used in the assimilation procedure. In some regions where the comparisons remain indeterminate, not enough ocean observations are available, and it is difficult to ascribe the residuals to either the model or the observations. Although problems remain, a useful first solution to the global time‐dependent ocean state estimation problem has been found. The estimates will continue to improve through the evolution of numerical models, computer power increases, more data, and more efficient estimation methods.}",

The task of minimizing a cost function measuring the ocean simulation versus observation misfit is achieved through efficient calculation of the cost gradient w.r.t. a set of controls via the adjoint technique. The adjoint code of the parallel MIT general circulation model is generated using TAMC or its successor TAF. To achieve a tractable problem in both CPU and memory requirements, in the light of control flow reversal, the adjoint code relies heavily on the balancing of storing versus recomputation via the checkpointing method. Further savings are achieved by exploiting self-adjointness of part of the computation. To retain scalability of domain decomposition-based parallelism, hand-written adjoint routines are provided. These complement routines of the parallel support package to perform corresponding operations in reverse mode. The unique feature of the TAF tool which enables the dumping of the adjoint state and restart the adjoint integration is exploited to overcome batch execution limitations on HPC machines for large-scale ocean and climate simulations. Strategies to test the correctness of the adjoint-generated gradient are presented. The size of a typical adjoint application is illustrated for the case of the global ocean state estimation problem undertaken by the SIO-JPL-MIT Consortium “Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean” (ECCO). Results are given by way of example.}",

Both components are publicly available and subjected to regular, automated regression tests. The modeling framework includes sets of global conformal grids, a global model setup, implementations of data constraints and control parameters, an interface to algorithmic differentiation, as well as a grid-independent, fully capable Matlab toolbox. The baseline ECCO v4 solution is a dynamically consistent ocean state estimate without unidentified sources of heat and buoyancy, which any interested user will be able to reproduce accurately. The solution is an acceptable fit to most data and has been found to be physically plausible in many respects, as documented here and in related publications. Users are being provided with capabilities to assess model–data misfits for themselves. The synergy between modeling and data synthesis is asserted through the joint presentation of the modeling framework and the state estimate. In particular, the inverse estimate of parameterized physics was instrumental in improving the fit to the observed hydrography, and becomes an integral part of the ocean model setup available for general use. More generally, a first assessment of the relative importance of external, parametric and structural model errors is presented. Parametric and external model uncertainties appear to be of comparable importance and dominate over structural model uncertainty. The results generally underline the importance of including turbulent transport parameters in the inverse problem.}",

Adjoint techniques are used to compute the three-dimensional eddy stress field that minimizes the departure of the coarse-resolution model from climatological observations of temperature. The resulting 3D maps of eddy stress and residual-mean circulation yield a wealth of information about the role of eddies in large-scale ocean circulation. In eddy-rich regions such as the Southern Ocean, the Kuroshio, and the Gulf Stream, eddy stresses have an amplitude comparable to the wind stress, of order 0.2 N m−2, and carry momentum from the surface down to the bottom, where they are balanced by mountain form drag. From the optimized eddy stress, 3D maps of horizontal eddy diffusivity κ are inferred. The diffusivities have a well-defined large-scale structure whose prominent features are 1) large values of κ (up to 4000 m2 s−1) in the western boundary currents and on the equatorial flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and 2) a surface intensification of κ, suggestive of a dependence on the stratification N 2. It is shown that implementation of an eddy parameterization scheme in which the eddy diffusivity has an N 2 dependence significantly improves the climatology of the ocean model state relative to that obtained using a spatially uniform diffusivity.}",

The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. Open/ADF has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation, the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, Open/ADF uses components provided by the Open/AD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes, Open/ADF supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics, a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such as bottom topography as independent (control) variables.}",

A defining feature of the MITgcm is that it has been developed to be compatible with an algorithmic differentiation (AD) tool, TAF, enabling the generation of tangent-linear and adjoint models. These provide gradient information which enables dynamics-based sensitivity and attribution studies, state and parameter estimation, and rigorous uncertainty quantification. Importantly, gradient information is essential for computing comprehensive sensitivities and performing efficient large-scale data assimilation, ensuring that observations collected from satellites and in-situ measuring instruments can be effectively used to optimize a large uncertain control space. As a result, the MITgcm forms the dynamical core of a key data assimilation product employed by the physical oceanography research community: Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimate. Although MITgcm and ECCO are used extensively within the research community, the AD tool TAF is proprietary and hence inaccessible to a large proportion of these users. The new version 2 (MITgcm-AD v2) framework introduced here is based on the source-to-source AD tool Tapenade, which has recently been open-sourced. Another feature of Tapenade is that it stores required variables by default (instead of recomputing them) which simplifies the implementation of efficient, AD-compatible code. The framework has been integrated with the MITgcm model main branch and is now freely available.}",

In our variational approach, the length of the feasible assimilation window is limited by the size of the domain in control space over which the approximation by the derivative is valid. This validity domain is reduced by non-smooth process representations. We show that in this respect the ocean component is less critical than the atmospheric component.

Identical twin experiments demonstrate that this method can retrieve default values of the control parameters when using a long assimilation window of the order of 2 months. Chaos synchronization through nudging, required to overcome limits in the temporal assimilation window in the adjoint method, is employed successfully to reach this assimilation window length. When assimilating ERA‐Interim reanalysis data, the observations of air temperature and the radiative fluxes are the most important data for adjusting the control parameters. The global mean net longwave fluxes at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere are significantly improved by tuning two model parameters controlling the absorption of clouds and water vapor. The global mean net shortwave radiation at the surface is improved by optimizing three model parameters controlling cloud optical properties. The optimized parameters improve the free model (without nudging terms) simulation in a way similar to that in the assimilation experiments. Results suggest a promising way for tuning uncertain parameters in nonlinear coupled climate models.

However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present the first GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with ML components, and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best ML and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with ML models for 1-10 day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for 1-15 day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics such as global mean temperature for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140 km resolution exhibit emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs, and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.}",

    abstract = "{In this study, the flow and rheology of pre-collapse Larsen B ice shelf are investigated by using a combination of flow modelling and data assimilation. Observed shelf velocities from satellite interferometry are used to constrain an ice shelf model by using a data assimilation technique based on the control method. In particular, the ice rheology field and the velocities at the inland shelf boundary are simultaneously optimized to get a modelled flow and stress field that is consistent with the observed flow. The application to the Larsen B ice shelf shows that a strong weakening of the ice in the shear zones, mostly along the margins, is necessary to fit the observed shelf flow. This pattern of bands with weak ice is a very robust feature of the inversion, whereas the ice rheology within the main shelf body is found to be not well constrained. This suggests that these weak zones play a major role in the control of the flow of the Larsen B ice shelf and may be the key to understanding the observed pre-collapse thinning and acceleration of Larsen B. Regarding the sensitivity of the stress field to rheology, the consistency of the model with the observed flow seems crucial for any further analysis such as the application of fracture mechanics or perturbation model experiments.}",

The method is applied to infer the basal sliding coefficient and the rheological exponent parameter fields from surface velocities. The inverse problem is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem whose cost functional is the misfit between surface velocity observations and model predictions. A Tikhonov regularization term is added to the cost functional to render the problem well-posed and account for observational error. Our findings show that the inexact Newton method is significantly more efficient than the nonlinear conjugate gradient method and that the number of Stokes solutions required to solve the inverse problem is insensitive to the number of inversion parameters. The results also show that the reconstructions of the basal sliding coefficient converge to the exact sliding coefficient as the observation error (here, the noise added to synthetic observations) decreases, and that a nonlinear rheology makes the reconstruction of the basal sliding coefficient more difficult. For the inversion of the rheology exponent field, we find that horizontally constant or smoothly varying parameter fields can be reconstructed satisfactorily from noisy observations.}",

Martin, and G. Stadler, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 35 (2013), pp. A2494--A2523] we considered the linearized infinite-dimensional inverse problem. In Part II, we relax the linearization assumption and consider the fully nonlinear infinite-dimensional inverse problem using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. To address the challenges of sampling high-dimensional probability density functions (pdfs) arising upon discretization of Bayesian inverse problems governed by PDEs, we build upon the stochastic Newton MCMC method. This method exploits problem structure by taking as a proposal density a local Gaussian approximation of the posterior pdf, whose covariance operator is given by the inverse of the local Hessian of the negative log posterior pdf. The construction of the covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the data misfit component of the Hessian. Here we introduce an approximation of the stochastic Newton proposal in which we compute the low-rank-based Hessian at just the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point, and then reuse this Hessian at each MCMC step. We compare the performance of the proposed method to the original stochastic Newton MCMC method and to an independence sampler. The comparison of the three methods is conducted on a synthetic ice sheet inverse problem. For this problem, the stochastic Newton MCMC method with a MAP-based Hessian converges at least as rapidly as the original stochastic Newton MCMC method, but is far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian at each step. On the other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the independence sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and thus overall it is much cheaper. Finally, we present extensive analysis and interpretation of the posterior distribution and classify directions in parameter space based on the extent to which they are informed by the prior or the observations.}",

    abstract = "{Computing derivatives is key to many algorithms in scientific computing and machine learning such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, and stability analysis. Enzyme is a LL VM compiler plugin that performs reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) and thus generates high performance gradients of programs in languages including \$\textbackslashmathrm\{C\}/\textbackslashmathrm\{C\}++\$, Fortran, Julia, and Rust. Prior to this work, Enzyme and other AD tools were not capable of generating gradi-ents of GPU kernels. Our paper presents a combination of novel techniques that make Enzyme the first fully automatic reverse-mode AD tool to generate gradients of GPU kernels. Since unlike other tools Enzyme performs automatic differentiation within a general-purpose compiler, we are able to introduce several novel GPU and AD-specific optimizations. To show the generality and efficiency of our approach, we compute gradients office GPU-based HPC applications, executed on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. All bench-marks run within an order of magnitude of the original program's execution time. Without GPU and AD-specific optimizations, gra-dients of GPU kernels either fail to run from a lack of resources or have infeasible overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the problem size by either increasing the number of threads or increasing the work per thread, does not substantially impact the overhead from differentiation.}",

However, the corresponding memory requirement is proportional to the run-time of the evaluation program. Therefore, the practical applicability of the reverse mode in its original formulation is limited despite the availability of ever larger memory systems. This observation leads to the development of checkpointing schedules to reduce the storage requirements. This article presents the function revolve, which generates checkpointing schedules that are provably optimal with regard to a primary and a secondary criterion. This routine is intended to be used as an explicit “controller” for running a time-dependent applications program.}",

Applications include parametric optimization, saddle point problems, Benders decompositions, and multilevel optimization. In this paper we adapt a known automatic differentiation (AD) technique for obtaining derivatives of implicitly defined functions for application to optimal value functions. The formulation we develop is well suited to the evaluation of first and second derivatives of optimal values. The result is a method that yields large savings in time and memory. The savings are demonstrated by a Benders decomposition example using both the ADOL-C and CppAD packages. Some of the source code for these comparisons is included to aid testing with other hardware and compilers, other AD packages, as well as future versions of ADOL-C and CppAD. The source code also serves as an aid in the implementation of the method for actual applications. In addition, it demonstrates how multiple C++ operator overloading AD packages can be used with the same source code. This provides motivation for the coding numerical routines where the floating point type is a C++ template parameter.",
