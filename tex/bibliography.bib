The first reasons lie in the impetus that was given to the subject in the concluding years of the previous century by the seminal papers of Bashforth and Adams for linear multistep methods and Runge for Runge–Kutta methods. Other reasons, which of course apply to numerical analysis in general, are in the invention of electronic computers half way through the century and the needs in mathematical modelling of efficient numerical algorithms as an alternative to classical methods of applied mathematics. This survey paper follows many of the main strands in the developments of these methods, both for general problems, stiff systems, and for many of the special problem types that have been gaining in significance as the century draws to an end. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

    abstractNote = "In applied optimization, an understanding of the sensitivity of the optimal value to changes in structural parameters is often essential. Applications include parametric optimization, saddle point problems, Benders decompositions, and multilevel optimization. In this paper we adapt a known automatic differentiation (AD) technique for obtaining derivatives of implicitly defined functions for application to optimal value functions. The formulation we develop is well suited to the evaluation of first and second derivatives of optimal values. The result is a method that yields large savings in time and memory. The savings are demonstrated by a Benders decomposition example using both the ADOL-C and CppAD packages. Some of the source code for these comparisons is included to aid testing with other hardware and compilers, other AD packages, as well as future versions of ADOL-C and CppAD. The source code also serves as an aid in the implementation of the method for actual applications. In addition, it demonstrates how multiple C++ operator overloading AD packages can be used with the same source code. This provides motivation for the coding numerical routines where the floating point type is a C++ template parameter.",
