These fields develop formulations that integrate data into physics-based models while exploiting the fact that many mathematical models of natural and engineered systems exhibit an intrinsically low-dimensional solution manifold. In inverse problems, we seek to infer uncertain components of the inputs from observations of the outputs, while in model reduction we seek low-dimensional models that explicitly capture the salient features of the input–output map through approximation in a low-dimensional subspace. In both cases, the result is a predictive model that reflects data-driven learning yet deeply embeds the underlying physics, and thus can be used for design, control and decision-making, often with quantified uncertainties. We highlight recent developments in scalable and efficient algorithms for inverse problems and model reduction governed by large-scale models in the form of partial differential equations. Several illustrative applications to large-scale complex problems across different domains of science and engineering are provided.}",

Research in IML has boomed in recent years. As young as the field is, it has over 200 years old roots in regression modeling and rule-based machine learning, starting in the 1960s. Recently, many new IML methods have been proposed, many of them model-agnostic, but also interpretation techniques specific to deep learning and tree-based ensembles. IML methods either directly analyze model components, study sensitivity to input perturbations, or analyze local or global surrogate approximations of the ML model. The field approaches a state of readiness and stability, with many methods not only proposed in research, but also implemented in open-source software. But many important challenges remain for IML, such as dealing with dependent features, causal interpretation, and uncertainty estimation, which need to be resolved for its successful application to scientific problems. A further challenge is a missing rigorous definition of interpretability, which is accepted by the community. To address the challenges and advance the field, we urge to recall our roots of interpretable, data-driven modeling in statistics and (rule-based) ML, but also to consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and the social sciences.}",

In this work, we provide fundamental principles for interpretable ML, and dispel common misunderstandings that dilute the importance of this crucial topic. We also identify 10 technical challenge areas in interpretable machine learning and provide history and background on each problem. Some of these problems are classically important, and some are recent problems that have arisen in the last few years. These problems are: (1) Optimizing sparse logical models such as decision trees; (2) Optimization of scoring systems; (3) Placing constraints into generalized additive models to encourage sparsity and better interpretability; (4) Modern case-based reasoning, including neural networks and matching for causal inference; (5) Complete supervised disentanglement of neural networks; (6) Complete or even partial unsupervised disentanglement of neural networks; (7) Dimensionality reduction for data visualization; (8) Machine learning models that can incorporate physics and other generative or causal constraints; (9) Characterization of the “Rashomon set” of good models; and (10) Interpretable reinforcement learning.
