    \textbf{To the community, by the community.}
    \textit{This manuscript was conceived with the goal of shortening the gap between developers and practitioners of differential programming applied to  modern scientific machine learning. 
    With the advent of new tools and new software, it is important to create pedagogical contents that allow the broader community to understand these methods. 
    We hope this encourages new members to be an active part of the ecosystem, by using and developing open-source tools. 
    This work was done under the premise \textbf{open-science from scratch}, meaning all the contents of this work, both code and text, had been in the open from the start and that any interested person can jump in and contribute to the project.
