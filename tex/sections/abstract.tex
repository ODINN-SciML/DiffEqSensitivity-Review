Differentiable programming has become a central piece in modern machine learning techniques. 
In the context of models describe by differential equations, calculation of sensitivities and gradients require careful algebraic and numeric manipulations of the underlying dynamical system.
In this work, we aim to summarize some of the most used techniques that exists to compute gradients on numerical models that include numerical solutions of differential equations. 
We cover this problem by first introducing motivations in current areas or research, such as geophysics; the mathematical foundations of the different approaches; and finally the computational consideration and solutions that exist in modern scientific software.
