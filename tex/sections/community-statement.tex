    % \textbf{To the community, by the community.}
    \textit{This manuscript was conceived with the goal of shortening the gap between developers and practitioners of differentiable programming applied to modern scientific machine learning. 
    With the advent of new tools and new software, it is important to create pedagogical content that allows the broader community to understand and integrate these methods into their workflows. 
    We hope this encourages new people to be an active part of the ecosystem, by using and developing open-source tools. 
    This work was done under the premise \textbf{open-science from scratch}, meaning all the contents of this work, both code and text, have been in the open from the beginning and that any interested person can contribute to the project.
