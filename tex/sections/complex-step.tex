An alternative to finite differences that avoids rounding errors is based on complex variable analysis. 
The first proposals originated in 1967 using the Cauchy integral theorem involving the numerical evaluation of a complex-valued integral \cite{Lyness_1967, Lyness_Moler_1967}.
A new approach recently emerged that uses the complex generalization of a real function to evaluate its derivatives \cite{Squire_Trapp_1998_complex_diff, Martins_Sturdza_Alonso_2003_complex_differentiation}. 
Assuming that the function $L(\theta)$ is admits an holomorphic extension (that is, it can be extended to a complex-valued function that is analytical and differentiable\cite{stein2010complex}), the Cauchy-Riemann conditions can be used to evaluate the derivative with respect to one single scalar parameter $\theta \in \R$ as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dL}{d\theta} = \lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{\text{Im}(L(\theta + i \varepsilon))}{\varepsilon},
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the imaginary unit satisfying $i^2 = -1$. 
The order of this approximation can be found using the Taylor expansion of a function,
\begin{equation}
    L(\theta + i \varepsilon)
    = 
    L(\theta) + i \varepsilon \frac{dL}{d\theta} 
    - 
    \frac 1 2  \varepsilon^2
    \frac{d^2 L}{d\theta^2}
    + 
    \mathcal O (\varepsilon^3).
\end{equation}
Computing the imaginary part $\text{Im}(L(\theta + i \varepsilon))$ leads to
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dL}{d\theta} 
    = 
    \frac{\text{Im}(L(\theta + i \varepsilon))}{\varepsilon}
    + 
    \mathcal{O} (\varepsilon^2).
\end{equation}
The method of \textit{complex step differentiation} consists then in estimating the gradient as $\text{Im}(L(\theta + i \varepsilon)) / \varepsilon$ for a small value of $\varepsilon$. 
Besides the advantage of being a method with precision $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$, the complex step method avoids subtracting cancellation error and then the value of $\varepsilon$ can be reduced to almost machine precision error without affecting the calculation of the derivative. 
However, a major limitation of this method is that it works just for complex analytical functions \cite{Martins_Sturdza_Alonso_2003_complex_differentiation}.
Extension to higher order derivatives can be done by introducing multicomplex variables \cite{Lantoine_Russell_Dargent_2012}.
