An alternative to finite differences that avoids rounding errors is based complex variable analysis. 
The first proposals originated in 1967 using the Cauchy integral theorem involving the numerical evaluation of a complex valued integral \cite{Lyness_1967, Lyness_Moler_1967} .
A new approach recently emerged that uses the Taylor expansion of a function to define its complex generalization \cite{Squire_Trapp_1998_complex_diff}. 
Assuming that we have one single scalar parameter $\theta \in \R$, then the function $L(\theta)$ can be expanded as 
the Taylor expansion
\begin{equation}
    L(\theta + i \, \varepsilon)
    = 
    L(\theta) + i \varepsilon L'(\theta) 
    - 
    \frac 1 2
    L''(\theta) \varepsilon^2
    + 
    \mathcal O (\varepsilon^3),
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property $i^2 = -1$. 
From this equation we can observed that many factors vanish when we compute the imaginary part $\text{Im}(L(\theta + i \varepsilon))$, which leads to
\begin{equation}
    L'(\theta) 
    = 
    \frac{\text{Im}(L(\theta + i \varepsilon))}{\varepsilon}
    + 
    \mathcal{O} (\varepsilon^2)
\end{equation}
The method of \textit{complex step differentiation} consist then in estimating the gradient as $\text{Im}(L(\theta + i \varepsilon)) / \varepsilon$ for a small value of $\varepsilon$. 
Besides the advantage of being a method with precision $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$, the complex step method avoids subtracting cancellation error and then the value of $\varepsilon$ can be reduce to almost machine precision error without affecting the calculation of the derivative. 

Extension to higher order derivatives can be done by introducing multicomplex variables \cite{Lantoine_Russell_Dargent_2012}. 

Other authors had suggested to use complex variable analysis to compute the derivative as the imaginary part of $L(\theta + i \varepsilon)/h$, which coincides with $L'(\theta)$ for the case where $\theta$ is a scalar \cite{ Martins_Sturdza_Alonso_2003_complex_differentiation}.
% This approach was later generalized to the multivariable case 
Although this solves the problem of cancellation errors in Equation \eqref{eq:finite_diff2} for small $\varepsilon$, this approach is just valid for cases where the function $L$ is known analytically.
