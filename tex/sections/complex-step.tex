Other authors had suggested to use complex variable analysis to compute the derivative as the imaginary part of $L(\theta + i \varepsilon)/h$, which coincides with $L'(\theta)$ for the case where $\theta$ is a scalar \cite{Squire_Trapp_1998_complex_diff, Martins_Sturdza_Alonso_2003_complex_differentiation}.
% This approach was later generalized to the multivariable case 
Although this solves the problem of cancellation errors in Equation \eqref{eq:finite_diff2} for small $\varepsilon$, this approach is just valid for cases where the function $L$ is known analytically.
