Sometimes AD is compared against symbolic differentiation.
According to \cite{Laue2020}, these two are the same and the only difference is in the data structures used to implement them, while \cite{Elliott_2018} suggests that AD is symbolic differentiation performed by a compiler.

% Also, complex step differentiation and dual number do the same.
% We can do this by considering the simple example of sin(x^2) and see the result of the two different operations.
