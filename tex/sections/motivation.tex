\subsection{Inverse modelling}
\todo[inline]{here I would focus on the philosophy of mechanistic vs data-driven models}
Scientific models from many domains have often been based on mechanistic (or process-based) models, represented as differential equations, involving the use of numerical methods to solve them. \todo{I would include this part in the introduction}.
\todo[inline,caption={}]{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Albert Einstein once said DEs are the most important conceptual advance ever made in human history
        \item Differential Equations start in 17th century with with Isaac Newton
    \end{itemize}}
From predictions of population growth (Malthus) to permitting the prediction of black holes (Einstein field equations), differential equations have provided huge scientific contributions since Newton.
% 
The parameters and processes within process-based models have traditionally been determined independently of the model, with empirical data for model validation and comparison \cite{hartig2012}. Independent estimation of parameters and processes rapidly becomes impossible as the number of state variables modelled increases, especially when considering highly non-linear processes. 
% the term "inverse modelling" seems actually missing
Inverse modelling, which consists in using observation data to recover the parameters of a model that can best explain the data, allows the bridging of this gap \cite{Wigner.1960, Rude:2018jv}. 
% 
The process knowledge embedded in the structure of mechanistic models renders them more robust for predicting dynamics under different conditions.
% 
Nonetheless, in the 21st century, with the unstoppable wave of data flooding all scientific domains, progress with such traditional methods has become more complex. 

In parallel, the field of statistics experienced a boom following the massive growth of data, signaling the era of data science and machine learning \cite{Cox:2017hv}.
With the advent of machine learning methods, it is possible to learn and capture extremely complex nonlinear patterns and information hidden in huge datasets. 
Machine learning models can be seen as the opposite of mechanistic models: they are flexible, data-driven and they do not necessarily respect domain-specific constraints. \todo{a big aspect of modern machine (deep) learning models is that they learn by th with multiple levels of abstraction, automatically extracting relevant features from large datasets \cite{LeCun2015}}.

At first sight, these two modelling philosophies can be seen as antagonistic, and this is more or less the way they have evolved in the last decades \cite{zdeborova_understanding_2020}. 
On the one hand, domain scientists have often been sceptical of adopting machine learning methods, judging them as opaque black boxes, unreliable, and not respecting domain-established knowledge \cite{Coveney:2016eb}. Predictions with correlative models assume that patterns contained in data can be extrapolated \cite{dormann2007}. However, they may fail to disentangle the respective impact of the numerous ecological processes at play and may fail to predict dramatic shifts in dynamics \cite{Barnosky2012}.
On the other hand, the field of machine learning has mainly been developed around data-driven applications, without including any \textit{a priori} physical knowledge. 
However, there has been an increasing interest in making mechanistic models more flexible, as well as introducing domain-specific or physical constraints and interpretability in machine learning models \cite{Molnar.2020sisk,Rudin.2022,Schneider2017,rasp2018,Yazdani2020,Abarbanel2018,Carrassi2018,Bocquet2019,Gabor2015,Gharamti2017,Curtsdotter2019,Rosenbaum2019,Toms2020,Brajard2021}.
% If both modelling approaches have different strengths, why not combine them and attempt to have the best of both worlds?

% A key way to achieve this is through differentiable programming, i.e., being able to compute derivatives of any computer program describing a scientific model.
% During the last decades, the backpropagation algorithm has enabled the fast growth of deep learning by efficiently computing gradients of large and complex neural networks with many parameters \cite{griewank2012invented}.
% Nowadays, the differentiation of hybrid models comprising data-driven models (e.g., neural networks, gaussian processes) with differential equations poses complex technical problems, which are only starting to be explored in recent years \cite{ma_comparison_2021}. 
% Being able to accurately estimate model parameters, ranging from a few ones in classic inversion problems to millions of them in 
% % \todo{I disagree, many geophysical inversions involve millions of parmeters; it's not specific to NNs.}
% large neural networks, opens many new possibilities. 
% Differentiable programming has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach and design scientific models and even the way we discover governing laws from data. 

\subsection{Domain-specific applications}

Differential equations can be used to describe a large variety of dynamical systems, while data-driven regression models (e.g., neural networks, Gaussian processes, reduced-order models, basis expansions) have been demonstrated to act as universal approximators, learning any possible function if enough data is available \cite{gorban_1998}. 
This combined flexibility can be exploited by many different domain-specific problems to tailor modelling needs to both dynamics and data characteristics.

\subsubsection{Geosciences}

Many geoscientific phenomena are governed by global and local conservation laws (conservation of mass, momentum, energy, tracers) along with a set of empirical constitutive laws and subgrid-scale parametrization schemes. 
Together, they enable efficient description of the system's spatio-temporal evolution in terms of a set of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Example are geophysical fluid dynamics \cite{Vallis:2016kv}, describing geophysical properties of many Earth systems, such as the atmosphere, oceans, and glaciers.
In such models, calibrating model parameters is extremely challenging, due to datasets being sparse in both space and time, heterogeneous, and noisy.
Moreover, many existing mechanistic models can only partially describe observations, with many detailed physical processes being ignored or poorly parameterized. 
The use of differentiable programming, combining PDEs and data-driven models (i.e. Universal Differential Equations) may add flexibility to mechanistic models in order to incorporate new governing laws from data (from either measurement or simulations) \cite{rackauckas2020universal}.

Arguably, the notion of differentiable programming has a long tradition in the geosciences in the context of solving large-scale geophysical inverse problems.
The overarching goal of such problems is to find a set of optimal model parameters that minimize a (usually weighted least-squares) objective or cost function quantifying the misfit between observations and the simulated state, subject to the constraint that the model equations be fulfilled. 
The constrained optimization problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem by way of \emph{Lagrange multiplier method}\cite{Vadlamani.2020}, also referred to as the \emph{adjoint method}. 
The corresponding \textit{adjoint model} computes the gradient of the objective function with respect to all inputs. 
Gradient-based nonlinear optimization, then, enables us to invert for optimal values of the unknown or uncertain inputs.
Depending on the nature of the inputs, we may distinguish the following cases:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Initial conditions:} Inverting for uncertain initial conditions, which, when integrated using the model, lead to an optimal match of the observations; variants thereof are used for optimal forecasting (see below);
\item \emph{Boundary conditions:} Inverting for uncertain surface (e.g., interface fluxes), bottom (e.g., bed properties), or lateral (e.g., open boundaries of a limited domain) boundaries, which, when used in the model, produce an optimal match of the observations; variants thereof are used in tracer or boundary (air-sea) flux inversion problems, e.g., related to the global carbon cycle;
\item \emph{Model parameters:} Inverting for uncertain model parameters amounts to an optimal model calibration problem. As a ''learning of optimal parameters from data'' problem, it is the closest to machine learning applications.
\end{itemize}
%
In addition to the use of gradients or derivative information for optimization, inversion, estimation, or ``learning'', gradients have also proven powerful tools for 
\begin{itemize}
\item
computing \emph{comprehensive sensitivities} of quantities of interest,
\item 
computing \emph{optimal perturbations} (in initial or boundary conditions) that lead to maximum, non-normal amplification of specific norms of interest,
\item
characterizing and quantifying uncertainties by way of second derivative (Hessian) information.
\end{itemize}
%
Within the framework of gradient-based inversion, all of these cases rely on the availability of an adjoint model of the (in general nonlinear) geophysical parent model to efficiently compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to a usually very high-dimensional (typically $O(10^3) - O(10^8)$) space of inputs.
In the following, we sketch how differentiable programming - from the perspective of adjoint modeling - has been used in different disciplines of geosciences, and how new concepts are emerging of combining inverse modeling and machine learning approaches where differentiable programming provides a key computational enabling framework. (Note that some authors have used the notion of ``scientific machine learning'' to capture some aspects of the latter approach [REFS]).

\paragraph{Meteorology.}
Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is among the most prominent fields where adjoint methods have plaid an important role. 
The work by \cite{Talagrand.1987,Courtier.1987} introduced the use of adjoint methods to infer initial conditions that minimize the misfit between simulations and weather observations. 
This led to the development of the so-called \textit{four-dimensional variational} (4D-Var) data assimilation (DA) technique \cite{Rabier.1992,Rabier:2000uu} at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as one the most advanced DA approaches, and which contributed substantially to the \textit{quiet revolution} in NWP \cite{Bauer.2015}.
Related, the adjoint method has been used extensively to infer patterns in initial conditions that over time contribute to maximum uncertainty growth in forecasts Gelaro -- \cite{REFS}, and to infer the so-called \textit{Forecast Sensitivity-based Observation Impact} (FSOI) \cite{Langland:2004jo}.
Except in very few instances and for experimental purposes \cite{Giering.2006}, automatic differentiation has not been used in the development of adjoint models in NWP.
Instead, the adjoint code was derived and implemented manually.

\paragraph{Oceanography.}
The recognition of the benefit of adjoint methods for use in gradient-based optimization or data assimilation in the ocean coincided roughly with that in meteorology, with some of the foundational work by \cite{Thacker:1988kp,Thacker:1988ed}. 
The first application appeared soon thereafter in the context of a basin-scale general circulation model \cite{Tziperman.1989,Tziperman:1992hg,Tziperman:1992jw}. 
An important detail is that their work already differed from the NWP applications in that sensitivities we computed not only with respect to initial conditions but also with respect to surface boundary conditions, i.e., air-sea fluxes of buoyancy and momentum.
Also, the role of the second-derivative, i.e., the Hessian for uncertainty quantification was readily realized \cite{Thacker:1989jf}.
Similar to the work on calculating singular vectors in the atmosphere based on tangent linear and adjoint versions of a GCM to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem, the question of El Niño predictability invited model-based singular vector computations in models of the Tropical Pacific Ocean \cite{Moore:1997ci,Moore:1997fp}.

\paragraph{Transport modeling \& flux inversion.}
% ... GEOS-Chem , Kaminski, ...

\paragraph{Glaciology.}

Glaciers act as slow fluids, flowing down-slope through the effects of gravity, and the understanding of their rheological properties (e.g. ice viscosity affecting internal deformation or sliding at the glacier-bedrock interface) is key to assessing their contribution to water resources and sea-level rise \cite{cuffey_physics_2010}. 
These rheological processes and their dependency on key large-scale environmental variables, such as the local climate or topography, are still not well understood.
Recent studies had showed how neural networks integrated with differential equations can be used to solve ice flow equations\cite{Jouvet_Cordonnier_Kim_Lüthi_Vieli_Aschwanden_2021, Jouvet_2022} and invert rheological properties at the same time \cite{bolibar_universal_2023, wang2022discovering}.  
% The use of differentiable programming, combined with Universal Differential Equations, holds great potential to learn new empirical laws of these physical processes from large-scale remote sensing datasets. 
% A recent study showed how Julia's differentiable programming capabilities can be used to optimize the parameters of a neural network, learning a function of the nonlinear ice diffusivity in a glacier ice flow PDE, to match observations \cite{bolibar_universal_2023}.
