In this section, we address how these different methods are computationally implemented and how to decide which method to use depending on the scientific task.
In order to address this point, it is important to make one further distinction of the methods introduced in Section \ref{section:methods} between those that apply direct differentiation at the algorithmic level or those that are based on numerical solvers.  

The first are easier to implement since they are agnostic with respect to the mathematical and numerical properties of the ODE; however, they tend to be either inaccurate, memory-expensive, or unfeasible for large models. 
The family of methods that are based on numerical solvers include the sensitivity equations and the adjoint methods, both discrete and continuous; they are more difficult to implement and for real case applications require complex software implementations, but they are also more accurate and adequate. 
This section is then going to be split in the following way.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct methods.} (Section \ref{section:direct-methods}) Their implementation is at a higher hierarchy that the numerical solver software. Includes finite differences, AD, complex step differentiation.
    \item \textbf{Solver-based methods.} Their implementation at the same level of the numerical solver. Includes 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sensitivity equations (Section \ref{section:computing-sensitivity-equations})
        \item Adjoint methods: discrete and continuous (Section \ref{section:computing-adjoints})
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Despite the fact that these methods can be (in principle) implemented in different programming languages, here we decided to use the Julia programming language for the different examples. 
Julia is a recent but mature programming language that has already a large tradition in implementing packages aiming to advance differentiable programming \cite{Bezanson_Karpinski_Shah_Edelman_2012, Julialang_2017}.
Nevertheless, in reviewing existing work, we will also point to applications developed in other programming languages.
