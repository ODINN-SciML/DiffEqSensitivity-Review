In this section, we are going to address how these different methods are computationally implemented and how to decide which method to use depending on the scientific task.
In order to address this point, it is important to make one further distinction of the methods introduced in Section \ref{section:methods} between those that apply direct differentiation at the algorithmic level or those that are based on numerical solvers.  
The first are easier to implement since they are agnostic with respect to the mathematical and numerical properties of the ODE; however, they tend to be either inaccurate, memory-expensive, or unfeasible for large models. 
The family of methods that are based on numerical solvers include the sensitivity equations and the adjoint methods, both discrete and continuous; they are more difficult to implement and for real case applications require complex software implementations, but they are also more accurate and adequate. 
This section is then going to be split in the following way.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct methods.} (Section \ref{section:direct-methods}) Their implementation is at a higher hierarchy that the numerical solver software. Includes finite differences, AD, complex step differentiation.
    \item \textbf{Solver-based methods.} Their implementation at the same level of the numerical solver. Includes 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sensitivity equations (Section \ref{section:computing-sensitivity-equations})
        \item Adjoint methods: discrete and continuous (Section \ref{section:computing-adjoints})
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Despite the fact that these methods can be (in principle) implemented in different programming languages, here we decided to use the Julia programming language for the different examples. 
Julia is a recent but mature programming language that has already a large tradition in implementing packages aiming to advance differentiable programming \cite{Bezanson_Karpinski_Shah_Edelman_2012, Julialang_2017}.
Nevertheless, in reviewing existing work, we will also point to applications developed in other programming languages.

\subsection{Direct methods}
\label{section:direct-methods}

Direct methods are implemented independent of the structure of the ODE and the numerical solver used to solve it. 
These include finite differences, complex step differentiation, and both forward and backward AD. 

\subsubsection{Finite differences}

Finite differences is easy to implement manually, do not require much software support, and provide a direct way of approximating a gradient. 
In Julia, these methods are implemented in \texttt{FiniteDiff.jl} and \texttt{FiniteDifferences.jl}, which already include subroutines to determine step-sizes.
However, finite differences are less accurate and as costly as forward AD \cite{Griewank_1989} and complex-step differentiation. 
Figure \ref{fig:finite-diff} illustrates the error in computing the gradient of a simple loss function for both true analytical solution and numerical solution of a system of ODEs as a function of the stepsize $\varepsilon$ using finite differences.
Here we consider the solution of the differential equation $u'' + \omega^2 u = 0$ with initial condition $u(0)=0$ and $u'(0)=1$, which has analytical solution $u(t) = \sin(\omega t) / \omega$ and can be numerically solved as the solution of the system of ODEs
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
    \frac{du}{dt} = v  & \quadd u(0) = 0 \\
    \frac{dv}{dt} = - \omega^2 u  & \quadd v(0) = 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
using the default Tsitouras solver \cite{Tsitouras_2011} from \texttt{OrdinaryDiffEq.jl}
We can see that finite differences is inaccurate of computing the derivative of ... with respect to $\omega$ when the stepsize is both too small and too large.
When $u(t)$ is instead computed with a numerical solver, the accuracy of the derivative further deteriorates due to approximation errors in the solver. 
This effect is dependent on the numerical solver tolerance.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{../code/finite_differences/finite_difference_derivative.pdf}
    \caption{Absolute relative error when computing the gradient of the function $u(t) = \sin (\omega t)/\omega$ with respect to $\omega$ at $t=10.0$ as a function of the stepsize $\varepsilon$. Here $u(t)$ corresponds to the solution of the differential equation $u'' + \omega^2 u = 0$ with initial condition $u(0)=0$ and $u'(0)=1$. The blue dots correspond to the case where this is computed with finite differences. The red and orange lines are for the case where $u(t)$ is numerically computed using the default Tsitouras solver \cite{Tsitouras_2011} from \texttt{OrdinaryDiffEq.jl} using different tolerances. The error when using a numerical solver is larger and it is dependent on the numerical precision of the numerical solver. }
    \label{fig:finite-diff}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Complex step differentiation}

On the other side, complex-step differentiation do not suffer from small values of $\varepsilon$, meaning that $\varepsilon$ can be chosen arbitrarily small (see Figure \ref{fig:finite-diff}). 
As we mentioned in section ..., complex step differentiation has many points in common with finite differences and AD based in dual numbers. 
% This resemblance between the methods makes them susceptible to the same advantages and disadvantages: easiness of implementation with operator overloading; and inefficient scaling with respect to the number of variables to differentiate. 
However, the difference between the methods also makes the complex step differentiation sometimes more efficient than both finite differences and AD \cite{Lantoine_Russell_Dargent_2012}, an effect that can be counterbalanced by the number of extra unnecessary operations that complex arithmetic requires (see last column in Figure \ref{fig:complex-step-AD}) \cite{Martins_Sturdza_Alonso_2003_complex_differentiation}.
It is also important to remark that many modern software already have support for complex number arithmetic, making complex step differentiation very easy to implement.


\subsubsection{Forward AD based on dual numbers}
\label{section:software-Forward-AD}

Implementing forward AD using dual numbers is usually carried out using \textit{operator overloading} \cite{Neuenhofen_2018}. 
This means expanding the object associated to a numerical value to include the tangent and extending the definition of atomic algebraic functions. 
In Julia, this can be done by relying on multiple dispatch \cite{Julialang_2017}. 
The following example illustrates how to define a dual number and its associated binary addition and multiplication extensions. 
\begin{jllisting}
using Base: @kwdef

@kwdef struct DualNumber{F <: AbstractFloat}
    value::F
    derivative::F
end

# Binary sum
Base.:(+)(a::DualNumber, b::DualNumber) = DualNumber(value = a.value + b.value, derivative = a.derivative + b.derivative)

# Binary product 
Base.:(*)(a::DualNumber, b::DualNumber) = DualNumber(value = a.value * b.value, derivative = a.value*b.derivative + a.derivative*b.value)
\end{jllisting}
We further overload base operations for this new type to extend the definition of standard functions by simply applying the chain rule and storing the derivative in the dual variable following Equation \eqref{eq:dual-number-function}:
\begin{jllisting}
function Base.:(sin)(a::DualNumber)
    value = sin(a.value)
    derivative = a.derivative * cos(a.value)
    return DualNumber(value=value, derivative=derivative)
end
\end{jllisting}
% With all these pieces together, we are able to propagate forward the value of a single-valued derivative through a series of algebraic operations. 
In the Julia ecosystem, \texttt{ForwardDiff.jl} implements forward mode AD with multidimensional dual numbers \cite{RevelsLubinPapamarkou2016}. 
Notice that a major limitation of the dual number approach is that we need a dual variable for each variable we want to differentiate. 
Incorrect implementations of this aspect can lead to \textit{perturbation confusion} \cite{siskind2005perturbation, manzyuk2019perturbation}, an existing problem in some AD software where dual variables corresponding to different variables result indistinguishable, specially in the case of nested functions \cite{manzyuk2019perturbation}.   

Implementations of forward AD using dual numbers and computational graphs require a number of operations that increases with the number of variables to differentiate, since each computed quantity is accompanied by the corresponding gradient calculations \cite{Griewank_1989}. 
This consideration also applies to the other forward methods, including finite differences and complex-step differentiation, which makes forward models inefficient when differentiating with respect to many parameters. 

If well forward AD is implemented independent of the differential equation and numerical solver involved, it is important to be aware of numerical stability and precision considerations.
Contrary to common folk, AD is not always \textit{numerically} correct and can lead to wrong gradients. 
To illustrate this point, consider the following example of ordinary differential equation
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
 \frac{du_1}{dt} = a u_1 - u_1 u_2 & \quad u_1(0) = 1  \\ 
 \frac{du_2}{dt} = - a u_2 + u_1 u_2 & \quad u_2(0) = 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
when $a=1$, the solutions are given by $u_1(t) \equiv u_2(t) \equiv 1$. 
This connection between numerical stability and dual numbers can be also understood by looking at how the sensitivity equations are derived. 

\subsubsection{Reverse-mode AD}
\label{sec:software-reverse-AD}

In opposition to finite differences, forward AD and complex-step differentiation, reverse AD is the only of these family of methods that propagates the gradient in backwards mode by relying in analytical derivatives of primitive functions, which in Julia are available via \texttt{ChainRules.jl}.
Since this requires the evaluation intermediate variables, reverse AD requires a more delicate protocol of how to store intermediate variables in memory and make them accessible during the backwards pass. 

Backwards AD can be implemented via \textit{pullback} functions \cite{Innes_2018}, a method also known as \textit{continuation-passing style} \cite{Wang_Zheng_Decker_Wu_Essertel_Rompf_2019}.
In the backward step, this executes a series of function calls, one for each elementary operation.
If one of the nodes in the graph $w$ is the output of an operation involving the nodes $v_1, \ldots, v_m$, where $v_i \rightarrow w$ are all nodes in the graph, then the pullback $\bar v_1, \ldots, \bar v_m = \mathcal B_w(\bar w)$ is a function that accepts gradients with respect to $w$ (defined as $\bar w$) and returns gradients with respect to each $v_i$ ($\bar v_i$) by applying the chain rule. 
Consider the example of the multiplicative operation $w = v_1 \times v_2$. Then
\begin{equation}
 \bar v_1, \bar v_2 = v_2 \times \bar w , \quad
 v_1 \times \bar w = \mathcal{B}_w (\bar w),
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to using the chain rule as
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial v_1} = \frac{\partial}{\partial v_1}(v_1 \times v_2) \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w}.
\end{equation}
% There are many libraries that implement reverse AD acroos programming languages \cite{Baydin_Pearlmutter_Radul_Siskind_2015}.
% In Julia, the libraries \texttt{ReverseDiff.jl} and \texttt{Zygote.jl} use pullbacks to compute gradients \cite{Innes_2018}. 
% When gradients are being computed with less than $\sim 100$ parameters, the former is faster (see documentation).


% \subsubsection{Further remarks}

A crucial distinction between AD implementations based on computational graphs is between static and dynamical methods\cite{Baydin_Pearlmutter_Radul_Siskind_2015}. 
In the case of a static implementations, the computational graph is constructed before any code is executed, which are encoded and optimized for performance within the graph language. 
For static structures such as neural networks, this is ideal \cite{abadi-tensorflow}. 
However, two major drawbacks of static methods are composability with existing code, including support of custom types, and adaptive control flow, which is a common feature of numerical solvers. 
These issues are addressed in reverse AD implementations using \textit{tracing}, where the program structure is transformed into a list of pullback functions that built the graph dynamically at runtime. 
Popular libraries in this category are \texttt{Tracker.jl} and \texttt{ReverseDiff.jl}.
There also exist source-to-source AD system that achive highest performance at the same time they support arbitrary control flow structure. 
These include \texttt{Zygote.jl}\cite{Innes_Zygote}, \texttt{Enzyme.jl}\cite{moses_Enzyme}, and \texttt{Difractor.jl}.
The existence of multiple AD packages lead to the development of \texttt{AbstractDifferentiation.jl} which allows to combine different methods \cite{Schäfer_Tarek_White_Rackauckas_2021}. 


% Since perturbation confusion also affects reverse mode AD, maybe is better to cover that here.

Notice that the application of reverse AD on a numerical solver (without checkpointing) scales as $\mathcal O (n k)$, with $k$ the number of steps of the numerical solver. 
Furthermore, when reverse AD is applied on the numerical solver, the step-size needs to be adapted to ensure the stability of the backward stesps, further increasing the computational complexity. 

\subsection{Solver-based methods}

Sensitivity methods based on numerical solvers tend to be better adapted to the structure and properties of the underlying ODE (stiffness, stability, accuracy) but also more difficult to implement.  
This difficulty arises from the fact that the sensitivity method needs to deal with some numerical and computational considerations, including how to handle matrix/Jacobian-vector products; numerical stability of the forward/backward solver; and memory-time tradeoff. 
These factors are further exacerbated by the number of ODEs and parameters in the model. 
% While explicit methods can be preferable for non-stiff problems, Rosenblock methods can be 
Just a few modern scientific software have the capabilities of handling ODE solvers and computing their sensitivities at the same time. 
The include \texttt{CVODES} within \texttt{SUNDIALS} in C \cite{serban2005cvodes, SUNDIALS-hindmarsh2005sundials}; \texttt{ODESSA} \cite{ODESSA} and \texttt{FATODE} (discrete adjoints) \cite{FATODE2014} both in Fortram; \texttt{SciMLSensitivity.jl} in Julia \cite{rackauckas2020universal}; \texttt{Dolfin-adjoint} based on the \texttt{FEniCS} Project \cite{dolfin2013, dolfin2018}; and \texttt{Diffrax} \cite{kidger2021on} in Python. 

It is important to remark that the underlying machinery of all solvers relies on solvers for linear systems of equations, which can be solved in dense, band (sparse), and Krylov mode. 
% This implies that methods based on numerical solvers are, in principle, more difficult to implement but also more efficient in computing gradients for complex differential equations. 
Another important consideration is that all these methods have subroutines to compute the VJPs involved in the sensitivity and adjoint equations. 
This calculation is carried out by another sensitivity method (finite differences, AD) and this also plays a central role at the moment of analyzing the accuracy and stability of the adjoint method. 

\subsubsection{Sensitivity equation}
\label{section:computing-sensitivity-equations}

For systems of equations with few number of parameters, this method is useful since the system of $n(p+1)$ equations composed by Equations \eqref{eq:original_ODE} and \eqref{eq:sensitivity_equations} can be solved using the same precision for both solution and sensitivity numerical evaluation. 
Furthermore, this is a forward method and it does not required saving the solution in memory. 
The simplicity of the sensitivity method makes it available in most software for sensitivity analysis, including ... 

However, for stiff systems of ODEs the use of the sensitivity equations is unfeasible \cite{kim_stiff_2021}.
For systems of stiff-ODEs, the cost of numerically stable solvers is cubic in the number of ODEs, making the complexity of the sensitivity method $\mathcal{O}(n^3p^3)$. 
This complexity makes this method useless for models with many ODEs and/or parameters. 

\paragraph{Computing VJPs inside the solver}

All the solver-based methods has to faced the challenge of how to compute large VJPs. 
In the case of the sensitivity equation, this correspond to the row/column terms in $\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} s $ in Equation \eqref{eq:sensitivity_equations}.
For the adjoint equations, although an efficient trick has been used to remove the most computationally expensive VJP, we still need to evaluate the term $\lambda^T \frac{\partial G}{\partial \theta}$ for the discrete adjoint method in Equation \eqref{eq:def_adjoint}, and $\lambda^T \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}$ for the continuous adjoint method in Equation \eqref{eq:casa-final-loss-gradient}. 
% Mention why these are different?
Therefore, the choice of the specific algorithm to compute VJPs can have significant impact in the overall performance. 

In SUNDIALS, the VJPs involved in the sensitivity and adjoint method are handled using finite differences unless specified by the user \cite{SUNDIALS-hindmarsh2005sundials}.
In FATODE, these can be computed with finite differences, AD or provides by the user.
In the Julia ecosystem, different AD packages are available for this task (see Section \ref{sec:software-reverse-AD}), including \texttt{ForwardDiff.jl}, \texttt{ReverseDiff.jl}, \texttt{Zygote.jl}\cite{Innes_Zygote}, \texttt{Enzyme.jl}\cite{moses_Enzyme}, \texttt{Tracker.jl}.

\subsubsection{Adjoint methods}
\label{section:computing-adjoints}

% Distinctio between discrete and continuous
% Discrete are the exact gradient of the computer program, continuous are not. 
% There is no flexibilty in discrete adjoitns, but there is in continuous
% Human effort required to compute discrete adjoints is large \cite{FATODE2014}

For complex and large systems, direct methods for computing the gradient on top of the numerical solver can be memory expensive since the large number of function evaluations required by the solver and the later store of the intermediate states. 
For these cases, the adjoint-based method allows us to compute the gradients of a loss function by instead computing the adjoint that serves as a bridge between the solution of the ODE and the final sensitivity. 
If well the adjoint method offers considerate advantages when working with complex systems, since we are dealing with a new differential equation special care needs to be taken with respect to numerical efficiency and stability
Some works have shown that continuous adjoints can lead to unstable sensitivities \cite{Jensen_Nakshatrala_Tortorelli_2014}.
Implicit forward schemes can give rise to explicit backwards schemes, leading to unstable solutions for the gradient. 

...

\paragraph{Solving the backwards mode and checkpointing}

The bottleneck of this method is the calculation of the adjoint, since in order to solve the adjoint equation we need to know $u(t)$ at any given time. 
Effectively, notice that the adjoint equation involves the terms $f(u, \theta, t)$ and $\frac{\partial h}{\partial u}$ which are both functions of $u(t)$. 
There are different ways of addressing the evaluation of $u(t)$ during the backwards step.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Dense Store.} During the forward model, we can store in memory all the intermediate states of the numerical solution. 
    This leads to heavy-memory expensive algorithms. 
    \item \textbf{Backsolve.} Solve again the original ODE together with the adjoint as the solution of the reversed augmented system \cite{chen_neural_2019}
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt}
    \begin{bmatrix}
       u \\
       \lambda \\
       \frac{dL}{d\theta}
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
       -f \\
       - \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}^T \lambda - \frac{\partial h}{\partial u}^T \\
       - \lambda^T \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} - \frac{\partial h}{\partial \theta}
    \end{bmatrix}
    % = 
    % - [ 1, \lambda^T, \lambda^T ]
    % \begin{bmatrix}
    %    f & \frac{\partial f}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \\
    %    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    %    0 & 0 & 0
    % \end{bmatrix},
    \qquad 
    \begin{bmatrix}
       u \\
       \lambda \\
       \frac{dL}{d\theta}
    \end{bmatrix}(t_1)
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
       u(t_1) \\
       \frac{\partial L}{\partial u(t_1)} \\
       \lambda(t_0)^T s(t_0)
    \end{bmatrix}.
    \end{equation}
    However, computing the ODE backwards can be unstable and lead to large numerical errors \cite{kim_stiff_2021, Zhuang_2020}. 
    \item \textbf{Checkpointing. } Also known as windowing, checkpointing is a technique that sets a trade-off between memory and time by saving intermediate states of the solution in the forward pass and recalculating the solution between intermediate states in the backwards mode \cite{Checkpoiting_2023, griewank2008evaluatingderivatives}. 
    This is implemented in \texttt{Checkpointing.jl} \cite{Checkpoiting_2023}.
\end{enumerate} 

One way of solving this system of equations that ensures stability is by using implicit methods. 
However, this requires cubic time in the total number of ordinary differential equations, leading to a total complexity of $\mathcal O((n+p)^3)$ for the adjoint method.
Two alternatives are proposed in \cite{kim_stiff_2021}. 
The first one called \textit{Quadrature Adjoint} produces a high order interpolation of the solution $u(t)$ as we move forward, and then it solves for $\lambda$ backwards using an implicit solver and finally integrating $\frac{dL}{d\theta}$ in a forward step.
This reduces the complexity to $\mathcal O (n^3 + p)$, where the cubic cost in the number of ODEs comes from the fact that we still need to solve the original stiff differential equation in the forward step. 
A second but similar approach is to use an implicit-explicit (IMEX) solver, where we use the implicit part for the original equation and the explicit for the adjoint. 
This method also will have complexity $\mathcal O (n^3 + p)$.

\paragraph{Solving the quadrature}

Another computational consideration is how the integral in Equation \eqref{eq:casa-final-loss-gradient} is numerically evaluated. 
Some methods save computation by noticing that the last step in the continuous adjoint method of evaluating $\frac{dL}{d\theta}$ is an integral instead of an ODE, and then can be evaluated as such without the need to include it in the tolerance calculation inside the numerical solver \cite{that-is-not-an-ode}.
Numerical integration, also known as quadrature integration, consists in approximating integrals by finite sums of the form
Numerical solutions of the integral 
\begin{equation}
    \int_{t_0}^{t_1} 
    F(t) dt
    \approx
    \sum_{i=1}^K \omega_i \, F(\tau_i),
\end{equation}
where the evaluation of the function occurs in certain knots $t_0 \leq \tau_1 < \ldots < \tau_K \leq t_1$, and $\omega_i$ are weights. 
Weights and knots are obtained in order to maximize the order in which polynomials are exactly integrated \cite{stoer2002-numerical}. 

Different quadrature methods are based on different choices of the knots and associated weights.
Between these methods, the Gaussian quadrature is the faster method to evaluate one-dimensional integrals \cite{Norcliffe_gaussquadrature_2023}.

\paragraph{Comparison between discrete and continuous adjoint}
