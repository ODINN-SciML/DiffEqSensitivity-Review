Symbolic differentiation is based on computer algebraic systems (CAS)
Usually, modern symbolic differentiation libraries also include subroutines to simplify numerical expressions for derivatives, making multiple executions of symbolic expressions very efficient. 

The final result of symbolic differentiation can lead to \textit{expression swell}, that is, exponentially large or complex symbolic expressions \cite{Baydin_Pearlmutter_Radul_Siskind_2015}.
An important piece of CAS is simplification routines to reduce the size and complexity of algebraic expressions by finding common sub-expressions.  
This can make symbolic differentiation very efficient when computing derivatives multiple times and for different input values \cite{DÃ¼rrbaum_Klier_Hahn_2002}. 

It is important to remark the close relationship between automatic and symbolic differentiation.
Both method compute are equivalent in the sense that they perform the same operations but the underlying data structure is different \cite{Laue2020}. 
Here, expression swell is a consequence of the underlying representation when this does not allow for common subexpressions. 
This can also been understood as if AD is symbolic differentiation performed by a compiler \cite{Elliott_2018}.
This means that the mathematical calculations involved are the same, but they need to be interpreted by the compiler at the moment of computing the derivative. 
Something like $x + 2$ needs to be understood as an \textit{expression} composed by a variable $x$, a literal $2$, and a binary operation $+$ binding them.
